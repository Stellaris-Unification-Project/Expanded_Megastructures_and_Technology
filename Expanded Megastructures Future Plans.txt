Become the Crisis
- Can choose options:
- assimilators can gray-goo the galaxy, assimilates entire galaxy, crisis sphere spawns gray-goo ships instead of shroud ships

Tech:
- Terravores, tech that gives + space mining bonus, chance to find more mineral deposits in systems
- Mark nanite techs as dangerous: nanite late-game crisis (may require expanded events to actually fire the crisis)
	- warning signs before nanites strike
	- idea: nanites spawn new ships with each enemy ship destroyed, enemy planet conquered
	- gray-goos systems under its control, spawning nanite deposits and new ships
- Dark Matter Singularity, gives 125 energy, costs 1 dark matter, uses fe singularity building image
- Psionic Capacitors, +15% shields, +5% Evasion, costs 20 alloys and 1 zro, requires Psionic Shields
- Dark Matter Ordinance, gives +20% orbital bombardment damage, costs 10 alloys and 0.5 dark matter
- Nanite Hull Plating, gives 185 / 465 / 1110 hull points, costs 0.25 / 0.5 / 1 nanite
- Nanite Replicator, converts 30 minerals into 15 alloys, upkeep of 6 energy and 1 nanite
- Nanite Fabricator, converts 30 minerals into 30 consumer goods, upkeep of 6 energy and 1 nanite
- Fallen Empire building techs, disabled with Zenith of a Fallen Empires 

Megastructures:
- Mega factory (not final name?)
- Turns huge amounts of minerals into alloys and consumer goods (gestalts only get alloys unless servitor)
- Will automatically turn off during a mineral deficit

- Can build enigmatic fortress
- tech requires both enigmatic techs and mega-engineering
- tech very unlikely to spawn without the enigmatic technology perk
- can only be built once, requires large amounts of unity to build another
- ai will prefer to build them in their capital system first, followed by other important colonies, followed by border systems

Perks:
- Enigmatic Engineering, access to unique engineering techs:
	Auxiliary Components:
	+5% Fire Rate
	+20% Orbital Bombardment

Psionics:
New Covenant Effects:
	- The Whisperers in the Void
		- Edict that gives +2 encryption
	- The Composer of Strands
		- Edict that gives +1 pop assembly
		- random psionic slave species gets delicious (dense if lithoid, with expanded pops)
	- The Eater of Worlds
		- Edict that increases army strength and ship fire rate
	- The Instrument of Desire
		- Maybe other unique buildings
		- Edict that increases trade value
	- The End of the Cycle
		- higher encryption and codebreaking
	
- Patrons (except Eater and Cycle) will leave you once crisis sphere gets built up enough and starts really damaging the shroud
