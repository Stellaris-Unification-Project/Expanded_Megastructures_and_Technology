I have recently launched a [url=https://www.patreon.com/user?u=32677412]patreon[/url] page. I have a lot of future plans for my mods, but they will rely on your support to see fruition. I'm not planning on delaying releases for non-patreons or anything like that, but my patreons will get behind the scenes looks into upcoming content. If you enjoy my mods, I hope you consider donating a little.
