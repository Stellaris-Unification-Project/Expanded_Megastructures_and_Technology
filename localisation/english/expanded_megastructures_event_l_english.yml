megatech.2.name:0 "Dark Matter Power"
megatech.2.desc:0 "The technology of the Stagnant Ascendancies have long been left unquestioned, their capabilities so advanced of our own that they might as well be magic. Yet recently our technology has progressed enough for our researchers to begin to understand the outlines of their designs, and they have come away startled by just how much we still have left to learn.\n\nTake for example their ship's power core. As far as we are aware, zero-point power is the most efficient way to generate energy, extracting it from the vacuum itself, and yet their ships use power far in excess of what even zero-point reactors can provide. The rumor circulating around the galaxy is that somehow they are extracting energy directly from dark matter.\n\nIt should be impossible, and yet..."
megatech.2.a:0 "We must pursuit all possible avenues."
megatech.2.b:0 "Perhaps the Curator Order will know more."
megatech.2.b.trust:0 "Requires the §YCurator Order§! to have:\n£opinion£ Opinion +100\n"
megatech.3.desc:0 "Success! After many heated debates and scientific dead ends, our researchers were able to briefly create a dark-matter power source. While it lasted only a few seconds before it violently exploded, it was enough to prove that we are on the right track."
megatech.4.desc:0 "So you wish to know more dark matter power generation. We were curious when you would start asking those kinds of questions, given how much your civilization has developed.\n\nDark Matter energy is something we are intimately familiar with: this very station is powered by a dark matter reactor constructed during the height of our influence. Sadly the old schematics have been lost to the ravages of time, but our databases should hold more than enough information to put you on the right track.\n\nIf you are willing to accept our price, of course."
megatech.4.a:0 "You ask for a lot for just a foot in the door."
megatech.4.a.explain:0 "If we did not know you as well as we did, we would not be having this discussion at all. Our prices are non-negotiable."
megatech.4.b:0 "Your prices are too high for us"
megatech.4.b.explain:0 "A pity. We wish you luck making these discoveries on your own. May your explosions be sporadic and well-contained."
megatech.4.c:0 "We will pay your price"
megatech.4.c.explain:0 "Excellent! We will send you a secure link to our databases immediately."
megatech.4.d:0 "A favor for a favor?"
megatech.4.d.explain:0 "Friends can be worth their weight in platinum, in the right hands.\n\nVery well, we will send you a secure link to our databases immediately."
megatech.4.e:0 "How about dark matter instead?"
megatech.4.e.explain:0 "An interesting choice. Very well, we will send you a secure link to our databases immediately."

megatech.20.name:0 "New Life Project"
megatech.20.desc:0 "Our biological engineers will soon begin work creating brand-new forms of life, but first they need to know what sort of creature they should aim to make."

megatech.20.nope:0 "I've changed my mind"
megatech.21.desc:0 "Excellent! Now that we have some idea what we want our creation to do, do you have any preference for what our new lifeform should looks like?"

megatech.21.necroid:0 "Necroid"
megatech.21.random:0 "Its appearance doesn't matter"
megatech.22.desc:0 "We have done what was once thought impossible: we have created life from nothing, built from the ground up to suit our needs."
megatech.22.a:0 "It's alive!"
megatech.22.a.tooltip:0 "Three New Pops will be created on [new_species_planet_scope.GetName]."
megatech.23.desc:0 "We have done what was once thought impossible: we have created life from nothing. Yet the life we have made deviated significantly from our designs. The resulting creatures are shriveled and emaciated, almost corpse-like, their yellow skin scarcely covering the work of muscles and arteries beneath. Despite their death-like appearance, they are unnaturally strong and hardy, although this comes at the cost of greatly increased appetite.\n\nWhile argumentative and surly, these creatures are not generally prone to violence. Yet their grotesque appearance has inspired fear and revulsion among our people. They clearly will not intergrate cleanly into [Root.GetSpeciesName] society."
megatech.23.a:0 "We cannot abandon them now."
megatech.23.b:0 "Destroy these monsters!"
megatech.24.name:0 "Project Failed"
megatech.24.desc:0 "Our attempts to create new life have failed in the worst possible ways. Instead of the perfect creature we envisioned, horribly deformed masses of flesh poured out from our cloning vats. Most of them died within moments when their twisted bodies collapsed, but the survivors have massed together in a throbbing, shrieking horde. To make matters worse, they have escaped the laboratories and appear to be flocking towards our main settlements!"
megatech.28.desc:0 "We had thought we had mastered the ability to create new life, but our first attempts to implement them in practice have been met with setbacks and project overruns. After the latest test subjects exploded in their birthing tanks, we were forced to shut down the project for good. While we uncovered invaluable scientific data over the course of our experiments, we will need to start from scratch to achieve our original goals."
megatech.28.desc.b:0 "We had thought we had mastered the ability to create new life, but our first attempts to implement them in practice have been met with setbacks and project overruns. While the last batch seemed to develop according to plan, an unexpected failure of their immune system meant they did not survive for long outside of the sterile laboratory environment. While we uncovered invaluable scientific data over the course of our experiments, we will need to start from scratch to achieve our original goals."
megatech.30.desc:0 "Following recent advancements in the field of genetic engineering, the scientific community on [Root.Capital.GetName] is confident that we can recreate the original organic bodies of the alien race whose neural patterns were recovered from an ancient vault some time ago. We could upload these neural patterns into new bodies, and bring the aliens back to life."
megatech.31.desc:0 "After many trials and setbacks, our geneticists have finally managed to transfer the extinct aliens' neural scans into new organic bodies, and the results are exhilarating. The ancient aliens have fully regained consciousness and have expressed a desire to join our empire, offering to colonize a new planet within our borders."
megatech.31.desc_b:0 "After many trials our geneticists have finally managed to transfer the extinct aliens' neural scans into new organic bodies, and the results are exhilarating. The ancient aliens have fully regained consciousness and have expressed a desire to strike out on their own and rebuild their empire."
megatech.33.desc:0 "The aliens, whose minds we uploaded to new organic bodies, have left. They gathered early one morning on a small fleet of civilian spacecraft, setting course for a distant star system. So far we haven't heard back from them and we may never learn whether they reached their destination."
megatech.34.desc:0 "Reports are coming in that the aliens, whose minds we uploaded to new organic bodies bodies, have colonized a planet and now style themselves "the Awoken.""
megatech.35:0 "Our geneticists have returned with some highly disturbing news. After concluding the final day of "Project Limbo" with yet another seemingly failed attempt at uploading the alien neural scans to genetically engineered bodies, the scientists returned the following day to find the robots missing.\n\nSome believe the attempt succeeded after all and that the aliens stole away in the night, others that it's an elaborate hoax. We may never know for sure..."

Our researchers have only been able to make sense of a small fraction of [leader_target.GetName]'s notes, but what we have deciphered has lead to revolutionary breakthroughs."
megamegaexpanded.20.name:0 "Whisperers in the Void: §GEyes in the Void§!"
megamegaexpanded.20.desc:0 "The secrets imparted to our people by the Whisperers are of great use. Sometimes it bestows glimpses of far off places, or whispers incautiously-kept secrets. We have learned how to carefully map out these visions, allowing us to effectively use them as an additional pair of eyes.\n\nProcessing this flood of new knowledge has, unfortunately, proven to be very hard on one of our scientists, who has become particularly withdrawn and distrustful."
megamegaexpanded.21.name:0 "Whisperers in the Void: §RCorruption§!"
megamegaexpanded.21.desc:0 "The secrets imparted to our people by the Whisperers are of great use, but knowledge can always be misused in the wrong hands.

megamegaexpanded.23.name:0 "Whisperers in the Void: §RCowardice§!"
megamegaexpanded.23.desc:0 "Though the secrets imparted to our people by the Whisperers are of great use, some of them are also quite disturbing - how one is fated to die for example. §Y[leader_target.GetTitle] [leader_target.GetName]§! reacted poorly when [leader_target.GetSheHe] accidentally learned such a secret, and has become increasingly cautious and cowardly on the battlefield."
megamegaexpanded.25.name:0 "Whisperers in the Void: §GLessons§!"
megamegaexpanded.25.desc:0 "The Whisperers in the Void sometimes takes special interest in certain individuals. Recently it has focused its attention on §Y[leader_target.GetTitle] [leader_target.GetName]§!, giving [leader_target.GetHerHim] unique guidance that has vastly accelerated [leader_target.GetHerHis] professional growth."
